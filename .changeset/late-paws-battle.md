feat: support native esm plugins

If you're not ready for native esm, please use versions `<1`, see [#61](https://github.com/JounQin/remark-preset-prettier/issues/61) for more details.

Or you can try something like [`yarn-deduplicate`](https://github.com/atlassian/yarn-deduplicate) with `yarn-deduplicate --strategy fewer` without guarantee.
